displayTest="MATCH_VERSION" # //F figure out what differences between server and clientside mods are and if we need to design 2 systems for this mod

# Display Test controls the display for your mod in the server connection screen
# MATCH_VERSION means that your mod will cause a red X if the versions on client and server differ. This is the default behaviour and should be what you choose if you have server and client elements to your mod.
# IGNORE_SERVER_VERSION means that your mod will not cause a red X if it's present on the server but not on the client. This is what you should use if you're a server only mod.
# IGNORE_ALL_VERSION means that your mod will not cause a red X if it's present on the client or the server. This is a special case and should only be used if your mod has no server component.
# NONE means that no display test is set on your mod. You need to do this yourself, see IExtensionPoint.DisplayTest for more information. You can define any scheme you wish with this value.
# IMPORTANT NOTE: this is NOT an instruction as to which environments (CLIENT or DEDICATED SERVER) your mod loads on. Your mod should load (and maybe do nothing!) whereever it finds itself.
#displayTest="MATCH_VERSION" # if nothing is specified, MATCH_VERSION is the default when clientSideOnly=false, otherwise IGNORE_ALL_VERSION when clientSideOnly=true (#optional)

#//F Dependencies config (dont touch for now)
# A dependency - use the . to indicate dependency for a specific modid. Dependencies are optional.
#[[dependencies.${mod_id}]] #optional
#    # the modid of the dependency
#    modId="forge" #mandatory
#    # Does this dependency have to exist - if not, ordering below must be specified
#    mandatory=true #mandatory
#    # The version range of the dependency
#    versionRange="${forge_version_range}" #mandatory
#    # An ordering relationship for the dependency - BEFORE or AFTER required if the dependency is not mandatory
#    # BEFORE - This mod is loaded BEFORE the dependency
#    # AFTER - This mod is loaded AFTER the dependency
#    ordering="NONE"
#    # Side this dependency is applied on - BOTH, CLIENT, or SERVER
#    side="BOTH"
## Here's another dependency
#[[dependencies.${mod_id}]]
#    modId="minecraft"
#    mandatory=true
#    # This version range declares a minimum of the current minecraft version up to but not including the next major version
#    versionRange="${minecraft_version_range}"
#    ordering="NONE"
#    side="BOTH"
#
## Features are specific properties of the game environment, that you may want to declare you require. This example declares
## that your mod requires GL version 3.2 or higher. Other features will be added. They are side aware so declaring this won't
## stop your mod loading on the server for example.
